# Project 3 - Cache Simulator
This simulates a 2 way set associative cache. To use, enter an integer from 00 - 63 to load that memory block into the cache. To reset the cache, enter 'r'. To exit the program, enter 'q'.

## Compilation
This project can be compiled by the following command, executed from the src directory:
```
g++ cachesim.cpp setcache.cpp -o cachesim.exe
```
Note that this requires the g++ compiler to be installed. To run the program, just run the executable generated in the terminal.
